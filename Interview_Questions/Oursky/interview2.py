"""Interview Question 2
Design a data structure for a cache

Design and implement a data structure for a cache, which has the following functions:
get(key)
Return the value associated with the specified key if it exists in the cache, else
return -1 .
put(key, value, weight)
Associate value with key in the cache, such that value might be later retrieved by
get(key) .
Cache has a fixed capacity, and when such capacity is reached, key with the least
score must be invalidated until the number of key s falls within cache capacity. The
score is calculated as follows:
weight âˆ• [ln(current_time - last_accessed_time + 1) + 1]
Implementation of the cache should be optimized on the time complexity of get(key) .
For example, the average time complexity of get(key) could be constant.
For the purpose of implementing the cache, you could assume that common data
structures, such as arrays, different types of lists, and hash tables, are available.
At the end of the answer, give and explain the computational complexity of get(key) and
put(...) in Big O notation.
